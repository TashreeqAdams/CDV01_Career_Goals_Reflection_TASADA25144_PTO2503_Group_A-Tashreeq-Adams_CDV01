2. **Interests and Values**:
   The key interests related to my current career is problem solving and creativity. Being able to solve problems and face challenges is very important as it drives me to overcome obstacles and stay invested in the task I am undertaking. Without the opportunity to solve problems it mitigates the opportunity to think critically which fosters an environemnt of intrinsic growth. Problem solving also sparks creativity and innovation in which one has to think out of the box and in many different angles to find the best fit solution to a problem. When constantly being faced with problems, and being allowed to be creative in finding the solution, growth is endless, which is why these two aspects are the most important to me in my career.

   Organisational values such as integrity, innovation, quality, excellence and interpersonal values such as respect, teamwork, empathy and inclusivity are important to me in a work environment.

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
   The industries and roles I have explored are:

   - Software developer
   - Software support administrator
   - Instructional Designer
   - E-learning professional

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
   The above mentioned roles are roles, wherein facing problems creatively, is a daily standard and allows me to build material or products from scratch and alter them to cater for clients needs. Each role allows for creative innovation, allowing the exploration of new ways to run processes or develop. These roles are also not done autonomously and teamwork values are very necessary to meet client goals.

   The gaps or areas for further exploration are as follows:

   - Finding a bridge between Software Development and Instructional Design: Looking into apps or systems that are robust and pedagogically sound. This will create seamless e-learning.
   - Looking into using other languages to build e-learning interactions, Javascript aand Python etc. or find more ways for them to integrate into e-learning.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

   Year 3: In year 3 I aim to be in a junior software developer position or a support developer position in my current company or a new company.

   Quality - In the beginning of my career as a junior software dev or support dev I will be focusing on the fundamentals and learning best practices to ensure the utomst quality.

   Teamwork and respect - As a junior I will have the opportunity to learn from seniors and collaborate, in which respect and teamwork will be fundamental to delivering products to clients.

   Innovation and Excellence - Working for an international company will ensure I am able to learn and implement global standards and practices.

   Respect and Empathy - Working remotely will require clear communication and sympathy towards various cultures.

   Integrity and Quality - Working remotely requires one to hold themself accountable for delivering quality work independently.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:

   - Set aside 6-8 hours per week to complete courseware and submit challenges.
   - Attend all classes once a week.
   - Ensure that all submissions are uploaded before cut off time.
   - Engage with my coach and peer during classes to cover all blindspots and possible misunderstandings.

   The resources and support required is as follows:

   - All courseware (Career starter software development) to be provided, is required.
   - Clear concise communication from programme co-ordinators.
   - A helpful coach with supportive attitude.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
   First and foremost the Career Starter course needs to be completed by April 2026. This sets the foundation for the transition into the software developer space. Additionally it would be a bonus to receive high merit for the course, in which I would be more attractive to employers.

   Once I have obtained and secured the junior or support position, it is imperative that I pay very close detail to the fundamentals and basics, to ensure quality practices are withheld my side. As I transition further, learning more in my career, I would like to do more courses, to further my knowledge and set myself up for new roles and higher positions.

   Once my further studies have been completed I would like to be a senior. This will take the understanding of many coding languages and frameworks, and the ability to co-ordinate a team.

   The following skills and experiences may be required over the years:

   Year 3: Diploma/Certificate in Dev, GitHub, HTML/CSS/JS, Support certifications.
   Year 4: Cloud certifications, Advanced dev courses, start a BSc or equivalent.
   Year 5: Professional Dev certifications, Scrum, Entrepreneurship courses (I already have a Bachelors Degree in Commerce).

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:

   Lack of experience: Due to needing to climb up the hierarchy so quickly in limited time I might not be able to acquire all the experience required to reach senior level in time.

   Strategy - a strong portfolio is required including all GitHub projects and freelance work.

   Time management: Balancing work, business and study will be increasingly difficult my career progresses.

   Strategy - Planning a time based strategy, and setting daily, weekly and monthly goals. Accepting freelance work only when capable.

   Limited Network: Having a large network to provide me with the opportunities as I require them will be challenging.

   Strategy - Attend as many tech meeting as possible, whether in person or online, to create an awareness of my brand and value as a developer.

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:

   - Networking: LinkedIn, GitHub, hackathons, webinars amd coding events serve as a great source of networking. These events will avail me to many similar professionals, business owners and recruiters which can all add value to my journey. Codespace Academy also has a number of events and workshops I can attend.

   - Mentorship: As I attend these networking events I may be able to acquire a personal dev mentor, or alternatively have senior devs review my code and projects to identify elements of weakness and to instruct on best practices.

   - Educational: There are many free online resources such as freeCodeCamp, Coursera, edX, and Udemy for structured learning. Codespace also provides a number of courses in which I can enroll in as I continue my journey.
